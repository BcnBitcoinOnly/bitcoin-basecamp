LogLevel INFO

# Authentication:

#LoginGraceTime 2m
PermitRootLogin no               
#StrictModes yes
MaxAuthTries 6
MaxSessions 10

PubkeyAuthentication yes

# Expect .ssh/authorized_keys2 to be disregarded by default in future.
AuthorizedKeysFile      .ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys2

# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
PasswordAuthentication no                                                                                                                
PermitEmptyPasswords no

UsePAM no
```

### Install and config a firewall [1]
Uncomplicated FireWall (UFW)
```
sudo apt install -y ufw
```
Config some basic rules
```
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw limit $SSH_PORT/tcp comment SSH
```

Enable the firewall
```
sudo ufw enable
```

### Install Fail2ban
```
sudo apt install -y fail2ban
```

Configure fail2ban as (following)[6]


## Mount a storage device (i.e.: USB)[2]
You can mount your storage device at a specific folder location. It is conventional to do this within the /mnt folder, for example /mnt/mydisk. Note that the folder must be empty.
1. Plug the storage device into a USB port on the Raspberry Pi.
2. List all the disk partitions on the Pi using the following command:
```
lsblk -o UUID,NAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT,LABEL,MODEL
```
3. If disk is not formated yet, format disk to ext4
```
Check following link: https://superuser.com/questions/643765/creating-ext4-partition-from-console
```
4. Create a target folder to be the mount point of the storage device. The mount point name used in this case is mydisk. You can specify a name of your choice:
```
sudo mkdir /mnt/$DISKNAME
```
5. Mount the storage device at the mount point you created:
```
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/$DISKNAME
```
6. Verify that the storage device is mounted successfully by listing the contents:
```
sudo ls /mnt/$DISKNAME
```
Optional: (move /home or any other folder to the external disk)[7].

### Setting up automatic mounting
1. Get the UUID of the disk partition:
```
blkid
```
2. Find the disk partition from the list and note the UUID. For example, `5C24-1453`.
3. Open the fstab file using a command line editor:
```
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```
4. Add the following line in the fstab file:
```
UUID=5C24-1453 /mnt/mydisk fstype defaults,auto,users,rw,nofail 0 0
```
Replace fstype with the type of your file system, which you found in step 2 of 'Mounting a storage device' above, for example: ntfs.
5. If the filesystem type is FAT or NTFS, add `,umask=000` immediately after nofail - this will allow all users full read/write access to every file on the storage device.


## Install some utilities:
```
sudo apt install -y tldr tree locate debian-keyring logrotate lnav dnsutils docker docker-compose qrencode
```

### Install backups utilities
```
sudo apt install -y borgbackup rsync rclone
```


### Install Git
```
sudo apt install -y git
```
#### Set Global Credentials
Set your username:
```
git config --global user.name $GIT_USER
```

Set your email address: 
```
git config --global user.email $GIT_MAIL
```


#### Connect with GitHub by a SSH key
  1- Generate a SSH key
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C $GIT_MAIL
```
  
  2- Initiate the SSH-key agent.
```
eval `ssh-agent -s`
```

  3- Add the SSH key to your SSH-key agent.
```
ssh-add ~/.ssh/github.com
```
  
  4- Add the SSH key to your GitHub account.
  Copy the content of the key and paste in the Github SSH keys section.
```
cat ~/.ssh/github.com.pub
```


## Install Nginx and Let's Encrypt 
Install Nginx to use only as a reverse proxy. Webservers will be managed inside docker.

```
sudo apt install nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx php-fpm
```


## Install Wireguard VPN
Now, install Wireguard
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y wireguard linux-headers
```

Allow firewall rules
```
sudo ufw allow $WG_PORT/udp comment Wireguard
```

Start Wireguard on boot
```
sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
```

Allow IP forwarding (to allow DNS request in a different subnet)
Edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` and uncomment `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`. (Alternative recover from backups)

# Recover backups
To recover backups, always do it as `root` and with `cp -rp`. Only neccesary files. Watch out for `/etc/sudoers` and `/etc/passwd` specially. Don't override them.

##  Restore Mysql databases
Restore mysqldump file (.sql) from backup (see `var/lib/mysql/backups`).
Uncompress backup and:
```
gzip -dk db.gz
```

Restore all databases
```
sudo mysql -u root < db.sql
```
