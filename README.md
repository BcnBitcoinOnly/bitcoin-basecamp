# Mini-debian
This document provides instructions for the initial setup of a new installation of Debian on a server using the amd64 architecture. By following these instructions, you can ensure that your new server installation is configured with the necessary packages and settings to function properly. These steps are not necessary if you are recovering a system from a backup.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before you can use this repository, you will need to have the following software installed on your system:

- Debian 10 or later (amd64 architecture)

In addition, you should have a basic understanding of the following concepts and technologies:

- Command line interface (CLI) usage
- Linux system administration basics

If you are new to any of these concepts or technologies, there are many online resources available to help you get started. I recommend consulting the official Debian documentation as well as community forums and tutorials for additional guidance.
