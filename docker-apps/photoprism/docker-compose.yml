# Example Docker Compose config file for PhotoPrism (Raspberry Pi 3/4 and other ARM64-based devices)
#
# Note:
# - You have to boot your Raspberry Pi 3/4 with the parameter "arm_64bit=1" in config.txt to use our ARM64 (64-bit) image.
#   An "exec format" error will occur otherwise.
# - Try explicitly pulling the ARM64 version if you've booted your device with the "arm_64bit=1" flag and you see
#   the "no matching manifest" error on Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian). See documentation for details.
# - Use https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/armv7/docker-compose.yml for running PhotoPrism on ARMv7-based (32-bit) devices.
# - Running PhotoPrism on a server with less than 4 GB of swap space or setting a memory/swap limit can cause unexpected
#   restarts ("crashes"), for example, when the indexer temporarily needs more memory to process large files.
# - If you see Docker errors related to "cgroups", it may help to add the following to /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt:
#   cgroup_enable=cpuset cgroup_enable=memory cgroup_memory=1
# - If you install PhotoPrism on a public server outside your home network, please always run it behind a secure
#   HTTPS reverse proxy such as Traefik or Caddy. Your files and passwords will otherwise be transmitted
#   in clear text and can be intercepted by anyone, including your provider, hackers, and governments:

services:
  photoprism:
    ## photoprism/photoprism-arm64 has been replaced by a single multi-arch image for AMD64 and ARM64 (64-bit).
    ## Use photoprism/photoprism:preview for testing preview builds or :latest for the stable release:
    image: photoprism/photoprism:latest
#    depends_on:
#      - mariadb
    ## Don't enable automatic restarts until PhotoPrism has been properly configured and tested!
    ## If the service gets stuck in a restart loop, this points to a memory, filesystem, network, or database issue:
